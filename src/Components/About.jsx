          I am a passionate React-based front-end developer with a strong
          commitment to creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My
          journey into web development began after completing my Master's degree
          in English from the National University of Bangladesh. While my
          background may seem unconventional, my love for problem-solving and
          creativity naturally led me to programming. <br />
          <br />
          I started with PHP and Laravel, gaining a solid foundation in
          full-stack development. However, as I explored modern web
          technologies, I quickly realized the pivotal role of JavaScript in
          shaping the future of web development. This sparked my deep interest
          in React, and since then, I have dedicated myself to mastering its
          ecosystem. Today, I specialize in crafting engaging, efficient, and
          scalable front-end applications using React, Tailwind CSS, and
          Bootstrap. While I still have experience with PHP-Laravel, my true
          passion lies in building seamless and interactive user interfaces.
          <br />
          <br />
          Before transitioning into tech, I worked as an OTA Executive at Obeo
          Limited, where I managed international platforms such as Booking.com,
          Expedia, Airbnb, MakeMyTrip, and Ctrip. This experience helped me
          develop strong organizational, communication, and problem-solving
          skills—qualities that now enhance my ability to collaborate
          effectively in the tech world. <br />
          <br />
          Beyond coding, I have a deep appreciation for creativity and learning.
          I enjoy exploring new technologies, refining my skills, and
          contributing to innovative projects. Outside of programming, I love
          reading, traveling, and discovering different cultures, which keeps me
          inspired and open-minded. Whether it’s writing clean, efficient code
          or diving into a new book, I thrive on challenges and continuous
          growth. I’m always eager to take on exciting opportunities, push
          boundaries, and make a meaningful impact in the world of web
          development.
