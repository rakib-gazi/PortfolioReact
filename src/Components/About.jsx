          I am a passionate React-based front-end developer with a strong
          commitment to creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My
          journey into web development began after completing my Master's degree
          in English from the National University of Bangladesh. I previously
          worked as an OTA Executive at Obeo Limited, where I managed
          international platforms such as Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb,
          MakeMyTrip, and Ctrip, developing my organizational and
          problem-solving skills. <br />
          <br />
          Starting with PHP and Laravel, I gained foundational knowledge of
          full-stack development. However, I quickly realized the pivotal role
          of JavaScript in modern web development, which led me to focus on
          mastering React. Today, I specialize in building front-end
          applications using React and its ecosystem, with a solid understanding
          of modern tools like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. While I still have
          some experience with PHP-Laravel, my primary expertise lies in
          crafting engaging and efficient user interfaces with React.
          <br />
          <br />I am eager to contribute to innovative projects, continually
          expand my skills, and make a meaningful impact in the world of web
          development.
